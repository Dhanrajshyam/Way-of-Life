**Systematic inquiry and adaptive problem-solving**

**1\. Understanding the Problem (Clarity & Scope)**

* **What exactly is the problem?** (Defining the issue)

* **Why does this problem exist?** (Root cause analysis)

* **Who is affected by this?** (Stakeholders & impact)

* **Where does this problem occur?** (Context & environment)

* **When does it happen?** (Patterns & frequency)

* **How does it manifest?** (Mechanism & symptoms)

**2\. Exploring Solutions (Generating Options & Evaluating Feasibility)**

* **What are the possible solutions?** (Brainstorming)

* **Which solution is most effective given current knowledge?** (Efficiency)

* **Why is this solution better than others?** (Comparing trade-offs)

* **How can it be implemented?** (Execution strategy)

* **What resources are required?** (Feasibility assessment)

**3\. Optimizing the Process (Feedback & Iteration)**

* **How do we measure success?** (Defining key metrics)

* **What new information can improve this solution?** (Adaptability)

* **Which part of the solution can be optimized further?** (Refinement)

* **How can we test different approaches quickly?** (Rapid iteration)

* **When should we pivot to a different solution?** (Decision criteria)

This structure keeps your approach **adaptive, logical, and data-driven**, ensuring continuous improvement.

**Code Optimisation objectives:**

**Time Optimisation**

    \- improve processing time\* of a function  \- \*processing time: time taken to produce the output for the given input.

    \- improve data transport time\* of required data \- \*data transport time: time taken to retrieve and send data from storage to memory(cpu cache/ram) or (cpu \-\> memory/ram) or (memory \-\> storage).

    \- improve function retrieving time\* \- \*function retrieving time: time taken to retrieve required function from memory(ram/cpu cache) to processor.

    \- improve data sanitizing time\* \- \*data sanitizing time: time taken to remove unnecessary data and retain only useful data or minimum required data in organised way.

**Memory Optimisation**

    \- keep only cleaned data in memory and remove unnecessary data in active memory.

    \- organize data in such a way that it is quickly accessible by a function or processing unit.
